      <p>
       In this p5 sketch I was assigned to create a playable video game that had at least 3 different stages, and also a perosnal concept thathad a good balance of things such as, visual means, playability, and interactivness with the player.

        Reflections

      <p>
        With my game I attempted to mimic the well known arcade game 'space invaders' in which a players spaceship shoots rockets at aliens while moving back and forth on the x axis. This is probably one of the only projects in this class in which I gave nearly maximum effort even if that may not be fully reflected in the game itself. I devoted lots of time and combined many concepts we had learned in class to develop the game, and wrote nearly 1000 lines of code even if it may not have been written in the most efficent ways, I am proud of it. Although there are many bugs that need to be worked out it I believe it still plays alright and I enojoyed creating the visual concept and the characters. (restart button doesn't work, you must refresh if you want to play again).
