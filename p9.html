      <p>
       In this projet we were assigned to track at least 2 days worth of any kind of personal habit we have and translate it into an animated sketch. I chose eating fast food as my habit and attempted to track it using a graph that tracks the days of the week and the times a day that I eat out.

        I struggled with this project for some time, mainly because I did not set myself up for success. I didn't keep track of the data properly, and got lazy with the coding. If I were to redo this project I would attempt to accurately convey the data across legibly to the viewer in a more creative way. Also something weird is happening with the animation that did not happen when I made or presented the project and I am unsure as to why.
